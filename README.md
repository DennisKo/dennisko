## Work Experience

Since 2010, I've been helping companies deliver enjoyable, performant, and accessible user experiences. Some highlights include:

- **Building a search engine at [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org/):** Assisting in scaling the frontend to handle thousands of searches per minute and enhancing the search experience with AI.
- **e-Commerce at scale with [Zalando](https://www.zalando.com/):** Played a key role in rebuilding the B2B platform, integrating a Design System to improve developer experience and keep the UI consistent.
- **Enterprise SEO tools at [Searchmetrics](https://www.searchmetrics.com/):** Developed AI-assisted content editors before AI became mainstream.
